## Banking History (15 minutes)

- In the unlikely event that a majority of customers will withdraw their funds, the banks may have enough available cash.

- The oldest bank in the world [Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banca_Monte_dei_Paschi_di_Siena)



- **What are the key aspects of Modern Banking that are a complete departure from the traditional banking model**

1. Money market funding - CD's and other liquid products dealing in cash

2. Securitization - Derivative products made out of bank’s own assets or others’ assets, purchased for securitization, like loans and mortgages. A contract for the cashflows from the underlying loans and mortgage repayments

3. Originate to Hold – Bank’s would underwrite the products they issued, like loans, bearing the risk of default 

4. OTD – no limit to the scale of distribution if you don’t have to underwrite the risk

### 2008 GFC

- There is no answer as to what caused the GFC.
- Possibly one factor that fueled the GFC was lack of OTD regulation, which allowed individuals working at banks to approve bad loans and label them as good loans to sell them off. Regulation has been introduced to prevent this. 


## Banks Monetary Policy (30 minutes)

- Retail banks set their own rates for lending/borrowing
- The rate to set between banks is set by the Central Bank
- The rate set by the Central Banks usually effects the rates of the retails banks

**What is a liquid asset?**
- Any asset that can easily be converted to cash in a short amount of time

- **What is London Inter-Banking Offered Rate (LIBOR)?**
  - LIBOR is the benchmark rate which major global banks lend to one another on the International Interbank Market for short-term loans.
  - [Watch this video on the EuroDollar](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/understanding-stir-futures/what-is-libor-what-is-eurodollar.html)
  - The EuroDollar futures contract allows market participants to hedge/speculate on future interest rates.

- Central banks have a target for inflation and will typtically adjust their interest rates to adjust inflation, or encourage economic growth.

- Ask students to visit the [US Treasury website](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value_month=202203) and view some data.

- **What is an inverted yeild curve?**
- An inverted yeild curve is when short term rates are higher than long term rates
- This is of interest because long term loans have more risk and time associated, and are supposed to be higher than short term rates in a healthy economy
- Remember, Bond prices go up as rates go down. A surge in demand for long term bonds, with decrease in demand and price of short term debt will cause the yeild curve to invert.

- **How is inflation measured?**
- Commond index is Consumer Price Index (CPI), and PPI

- **What effect does interest rate have on inflation?**
- When the interest rate is high, people are encouraged to save in banks, lowering inflation by reducing spending (demand). Lenders win.
- When interest rates are low, people are encouraged to find returns in other markets (equities), spend their money, and borrow. The increase spending increases inflation.
