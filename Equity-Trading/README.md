### Market Cap

- General public can easily invest in public companies

  - Mega cap – companies that have a market cap of $200 billion or higher 
  - largest companies and usually represent the leaders of a particular industry sector, e.g., AAPL and Amazon.
  - Large cap – usually have a market cap between $10 billion and $200 billion, e.g.,
  - General Electric and IBM

## Dividends

- distribution of a company's earnings (cash or stock), typically twice a year.
- **Two main reasons to invest in equities:**
  1. Capital value (share price)
  2. Dividend value (income)

- Cash dividends are a taxable event for the receiver. 
- Instead of paying a cash dividend, some companies purchase shares in their own company.
- This increases the share price by nearly the same as the dividend payment per share would.
- There is regulation making this taxable if done too often.

- **Both dividends and stock buy backs increase shareholder wealth, and both are priced in the market**

- When cash dividends are paid out, it usually causes the company’s share price to drop. 
- When the market expects a cash dividend too be paid oout, it causes share price to increase well before Ex-Dividend date
  - If the market expects a 5% dividend to be paid by a company, the share price will usually increase 5% well before the Ex-Dividend date
  - When the company distributes cash dividends equal to 5% of the stock price shareholders will see a resulting loss of 5% in the price of shares (economic value transfer).
  - The market is competitive, it is difficult to buy a stock before a dividend pay out, get the dividend, and sell the stock. Designed for long term investing.

- Ex-Dividend Date - You must own the stock on or before this date to be paid the dividend

## Share Types

- A company’s Articles of Association sets out the different share classes it has. These
are some of the types of share class available. Most shares issued will be ordinary
shares otherwise known as common stock.

- Usually the different share classes are based around to entitlements to the following:
1. Dividends
2. Capital on winding up
3. Voting rights (decision making)

[different share types](https://www.wellersaccountants.co.uk/blog/how‐to‐understand‐the‐differenttypes‐
of‐shares‐class‐of‐shares#2)

- [Google has three types](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/whatsdifference‐
between‐googles‐goog‐and‐googl‐stocktickers.
asp#ixzz5FUL38qNM):
  - Class A—Held by regular investor with regular voting rights (GOOGL).
  - Class B—Held by the founders and has 10 times the voting power compared
to Class A.
  - Class C—No voting rights, normally held by employees and Class A
stockholders (GOOG).

**Why do Google’s founders shares have 10 times more voting rights, why not just create more shares?**
- Keeps the founders in control. 
- It is harder for a founder to sell a small portion, keeps founder 

## IPO Activity

## American Depositary Receipts (ADR)
- Allow investing in foreign companies on a US stock exchange
- ADR is a certificate issues by the bank. The ADR can represent any number of shares.
- Automatically converts dividends to USD
- Foreign companies can attract US investors
- TM, BABA, BHP

- Shares in the US tend to trade in the $100 region whereas shares in the UK trade in
the $/ 1 region, and rather than changing the minimum share price rules on
exchanges, they bundle the shares. E.g., 1 unit of HSBC ADR might be 12 common
shares. These are fungible, so you can buy a HSBC ADR in dollars and then sell 6 HSBC
shares on London in   and 6 in Europe in Euros.

trading is open, the market is always moving so every second counts. If you are
dealing with production issues, the urgency to resolve an issue will go up as you
approach the closing auction phase of the day. Traders will need to close out their
positions so they do not have risk overnight; if for some reason they cannot trade,
they will hedge their risks by buying some options/futures etc.

### Order Types
- Order types are your electronic way of specifying how you trade. Market and limit
are the two standard orders you would see in use most of the time.

## What is an Order Book?
- Live display of what orders in a stock are active on exchange
- Spread – the difference between the highest bid price and
the lowest ask price

- Most of the time, orderbooks are displayed with the bids on the left and asks on the
right as above.
- If at some point you see a bid price higher than that of an ask price you have a
crossed orderbook and it is likely that stock is in an auction or there is a problem with
market data.

- There is regulation on shorting stocks, to prevent market volatility.

- In addition to Basis Points, and Stock Ticks, Tick Size is a useful term that tells you the minimum increment of a financial product.
