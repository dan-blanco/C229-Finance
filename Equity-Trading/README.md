## Dividends

- distribution of a company's earnings (cash or stock), typically twice a year.
- **Two main reasons to invest in equities:
  1. Capital value (share price)
  2. Dividend value (income)

- Cash dividends are a taxable event for the receiver. 
- Instead of paying a cash dividend, some companies purchase shares in their own company.
- This increases the share price by nearly the same as the dividend payment per share would.
- There is regulation making this taxable if done too often.

- **Both dividends and stock buy backs increase shareholder wealth, and both are priced in the market**

- When cash dividends are paid out, it usually causes the company’s share price to drop. 
- When the market expects a cash dividend too be paid oout, it causes share price to increase before Ex-Dividend date
  - If the market expects a 5% dividend to be paid by a company, the share price will usually increase 5% before the Ex-Dividend date
  - When the company distributes cash dividends equal to 5% of the stock price shareholders will see a resulting loss of 5% in the price of shares (economic value transfer).

- Ex-Dividend Date - You must own the stock on or before this date to be paid the dividend
