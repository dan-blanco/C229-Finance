### Market Cap

- General public can easily invest in public companies

  - Mega cap – companies that have a market cap of $200 billion or higher 
  - largest companies and usually represent the leaders of a particular industry sector, e.g., AAPL and Amazon.
  - Large cap – usually have a market cap between $10 billion and $200 billion, e.g.,
  - General Electric and IBM

## Dividends

- distribution of a company's earnings (cash or stock), typically twice a year.
- **Two main reasons to invest in equities:**
  1. Capital value (share price)
  2. Dividend value (income)

- Cash dividends are a taxable event for the receiver. 
- Instead of paying a cash dividend, some companies purchase shares in their own company.
- This increases the share price by nearly the same as the dividend payment per share would.
- There is regulation making this taxable if done too often.

- **Both dividends and stock buy backs increase shareholder wealth, and both are priced in the market**

- When cash dividends are paid out, it usually causes the company’s share price to drop. 
- When the market expects a cash dividend too be paid oout, it causes share price to increase well before Ex-Dividend date
  - If the market expects a 5% dividend to be paid by a company, the share price will usually increase 5% well before the Ex-Dividend date
  - When the company distributes cash dividends equal to 5% of the stock price shareholders will see a resulting loss of 5% in the price of shares (economic value transfer).
  - The market is competitive, it is difficult to buy a stock before a dividend pay out, get the dividend, and sell the stock. Designed for long term investing.

- Ex-Dividend Date - You must own the stock on or before this date to be paid the dividend

## Share Types

- A company’s Articles of Association sets out the different share classes it has. These
are some of the types of share class available. Most shares issued will be ordinary
shares otherwise known as common stock.

- Usually the different share classes are based around to entitlements to the following:
1. Dividends
2. Capital on winding up
3. Voting rights (decision making)

[different share types](https://www.wellersaccountants.co.uk/blog/how‐to‐understand‐the‐differenttypes‐
of‐shares‐class‐of‐shares#2)

- [Google has three types](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052615/whatsdifference‐
between‐googles‐goog‐and‐googl‐stocktickers.
asp#ixzz5FUL38qNM):
  - Class A—Held by regular investor with regular voting rights (GOOGL).
  - Class B—Held by the founders and has 10 times the voting power compared
to Class A.
  - Class C—No voting rights, normally held by employees and Class A
stockholders (GOOG).

**Why do Google’s founders shares have 10 times more voting rights, why not just create more shares?**
- Keeps the founders in control. 
- It is harder for a founder to sell a small portion, keeps founder

## American Depositary Receipts (ADR)
- Allow investing in foreign companies on a US stock exchange
- ADR is a certificate issues by the bank. The ADR can represent any number of shares.
- Automatically converts dividends to USD
- Foreign companies can attract US investors
- TM, BABA, BHP

- Shares in the US tend to trade in the $100 region whereas shares in the UK trade in
the $/ 1 region, and rather than changing the minimum share price rules on
exchanges, they bundle the shares. E.g., 1 unit of HSBC ADR might be 12 common
shares. These are fungible, so you can buy a HSBC ADR in dollars and then sell 6 HSBC
shares on London in   and 6 in Europe in Euros.
